This is the release of the R code for generating reports from tabular medical datasets,
with the odds ratios, the chi2 tests and the t-tests and anova tests. This versions does 
not include the generation of the text, only the tables for the ORs and the tests. <br /> 

From the description file <br /> 
A set of functions for automatically generating a draft report from a health dataset in tabular 
form with a binary variable for the disease and any type of variable (categorical or binary, 
continuous or discrete) for the exposures which are the factors considered in the study. The 
package should be used with cautious by checking while completing the obtained output. <br />

Note  <br />
The code is an adaptation of the one writen when working at chu of cayenne (09/2019-08/2020) 
for helping medical students with their analysis and report from data and statistics. <br /> 
Without such code, the biostatistician has to redo this each time to help someone, but this 
is also part of epidemilogy because the non mathematical epidemilogy does not work on epidemy 
but on the data from hospital hence its includes (applied and informal) statistics.
